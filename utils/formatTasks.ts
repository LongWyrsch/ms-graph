/*
The function takes an array of object. Each object is a tasks. 
The tasks are nutrion type, so they are daily, and therefore have a "dueDateTime.dateTime" field.
There is also a "status" filed that can be "completed" and the "title" field.

So if a task has status = "completed", extract title and dueDateTime and add "true" in the google chart accordingly
    title = "fish oil"
    "dueDateTime.dateTime" = "2023-03-21T23:00:00.0000000"
